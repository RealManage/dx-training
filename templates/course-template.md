## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Self-Paced Learning (Recommended)

1. **Complete Prerequisites** → Check the list below
2. **Start Session 1** → [Foundation & Setup](./sessions/session-1/README.md)
3. **Practice in Sandbox** → Copy examples to sandbox for hands-on work
4. **Track Progress** → Use the checklist at the bottom
5. **Get Help** → Join `#dx-training` on Slack

### 💡 Sandbox Workflow

Each session with code examples follows this pattern:

```bash
# Navigate to the session folder
cd sessions/session-X

# Copy the example to create your personal sandbox
cp -r example sandbox

# Enter your sandbox
cd sandbox

# Start your development environment
```

**Why this approach?**

- ✅ **Safe experimentation** - Break things without fear
- ✅ **Clean git history** - Your work won't be committed (sandbox is gitignored)
- ✅ **Easy reset** - Just delete sandbox and copy again
- ✅ **Reference available** - Original example stays pristine

### Option 2: Cohort Learning

Join a scheduled cohort for group learning:

- Weekly 2-hour sessions
- Live demonstrations
- Peer programming
- Direct Q&A with instructors

Check `#dx-training` for upcoming cohorts.

## Template Usage Notes

When creating a new course using this template:

### Required Elements

1. **Replace all bracketed placeholders** with specific content
2. **Create session folders** with example code and a self-contained README
3. **Adjust the curriculum table** to match your session count (not locked to any duration)
4. **Include 3-5 objectives per session** mixing theory and practice
5. **Build progressively** - each session builds on previous learning
6. **End with a capstone** that consolidates all skills

### Folder Structure Requirements
