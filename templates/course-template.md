## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Self-Paced Learning (Recommended)

1. **Complete Prerequisites** → Check the list below
2. **Start Week 1** → [Foundation & Setup](./sessions/week-1/README.md)
3. **Practice in Sandbox** → Copy examples to sandbox for hands-on work
4. **Track Progress** → Use the checklist at the bottom
5. **Get Help** → Join `#dx-training` on Slack

### 💡 Sandbox Workflow

Each week with code examples follows this pattern:
```bash
# Navigate to the week's folder
cd sessions/week-X

# Copy the example to create your personal sandbox
cp -r example sandbox

# Enter your sandbox
cd sandbox

# Start your development environment
```

**Why this approach?**
- ✅ **Safe experimentation** - Break things without fear
- ✅ **Clean git history** - Your work won't be committed (sandbox is gitignored)
- ✅ **Easy reset** - Just delete sandbox and copy again
- ✅ **Reference available** - Original example stays pristine

### Option 2: Cohort Learning

Join a scheduled cohort for group learning:
- Weekly 2-hour sessions
- Live demonstrations
- Peer programming
- Direct Q&A with instructors

Check `#dx-training` for upcoming cohorts.
