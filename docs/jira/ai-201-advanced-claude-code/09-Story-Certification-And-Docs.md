## Effort Estimate

2 story points

## Prerequisites / Dependencies

- Story 08 (Week 5 Capstone)

## Description

Define the "AI Orchestrator" certification requirements for all four tracks. Create the certification document in `docs/certification/requirements.md` with track-specific requirements, evaluation criteria, and completion path.

### Tasks

1. **Certification overview** — "AI Orchestrator" as the 201 credential (complements AI 101's "AI Practitioner")
2. **Common requirements** — What all tracks must demonstrate
3. **Track-specific requirements** — Developer, Architect, PM, QA specific criteria
4. **Evaluation process** — How capstone is evaluated, who reviews, scoring
5. **Recognition** — Badge, certificate, profile updates

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `docs/certification/requirements.md` created with complete certification spec
- [ ] "AI Orchestrator" credential name and description defined
- [ ] Common requirements cover spec writing, team coordination, trust calibration
- [ ] All 4 tracks have specific certification criteria
- [ ] Evaluation process is clear and objective
- [ ] Minimum passing score defined
- [ ] Relationship to AI 101 "AI Practitioner" credential documented

## Technical Details

### Certification Tiers

```text
AI 101 → "AI Practitioner"    (Foundation)
AI 201 → "AI Orchestrator"    (Advanced)
```

### Common Requirements (All Tracks)

1. Complete all 4 learning weeks
2. Submit capstone project with passing score (≥3.0/4.0 average)
3. Demonstrate spec-driven development skills
4. Demonstrate Agent Teams coordination
5. Document trust calibration rationale

### Track-Specific Requirements

| Track | Additional Requirement |
| - | ---------------------- |
| Developer | Working code with tests, merged via orchestration pipeline |
| Architect | Architecture design doc with orchestration patterns |
| PM | Orchestration plan with stakeholder communication |
| QA | Test strategy across parallel workstreams |

### Evaluation Criteria

- Spec Quality: 25%
- Agent Coordination: 25%
- Trust Calibration: 25%
- Deliverable Quality: 25%

**Minimum passing:** 3.0/4.0 average across all criteria

## Testing

1. Certification requirements are achievable within course scope
2. Evaluation criteria align with capstone rubric
3. Track-specific requirements are role-appropriate
4. Relationship to AI 101 certification is clear
