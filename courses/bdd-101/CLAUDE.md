# BDD 101: Behavior-Driven Development Course Context

## Course Overview

This is a 3-session hands-on course teaching Behavior-Driven Development fundamentals to development teams with little to no BDD or test automation experience.

## Target Audience

- Small development teams (2-8 people)
- Developers new to BDD and test automation
- Product owners seeking better requirement specifications
- QA engineers wanting to improve test design
- Teams looking for better business-technical collaboration

## Course Structure

- **Duration:** 3 sessions, 2 hours each (6 hours total)
- **Format:** Interactive workshops with hands-on exercises
- **Level:** Beginner-friendly with practical focus
- **Delivery:** Can be delivered in-person or virtual

## Session Breakdown

1. **Session 1:** BDD Foundations & Gherkin Syntax (2 hours)

2. **Session 2:** Writing Effective Scenarios (2 hours)  

3. **Session 3:** From Scenarios to Automation (2 hours)

## Learning Objectives

By completion, participants should be able to:

- Write clear, business-readable Gherkin scenarios
- Facilitate Three Amigos collaboration sessions
- Transform user stories into testable BDD scenarios
- Avoid common BDD anti-patterns and pitfalls
- Set up basic BDD test automation
- Integrate BDD into their development workflow

## Key BDD Concepts Covered

- **Behavior-Driven Development principles**
- **Three Amigos** (Business, Development, Testing collaboration)
- **Gherkin syntax** (Given-When-Then structure)
- **Living documentation** concept
- **Scenario quality** and maintainability
- **Test automation** with step definitions
- **BDD anti-patterns** to avoid

## Technology Stack

- **Primary:** Gherkin scenarios (language-agnostic)
- **Automation Examples:** C# with SpecFlow
- **Alternative Tools:** Cucumber (Java/Ruby/JavaScript)
- **Text Editors:** Any text editor or IDE

## Practical Exercises Include

- Converting user stories to Gherkin scenarios
- Identifying and fixing poorly written scenarios
- Three Amigos collaboration workshops
- Setting up basic SpecFlow automation
- Peer review of scenario writing

## Common Challenges Addressed

- **Over-specification** in scenarios
- **Technical jargon** that business can't understand
- **Fragile automation** due to poor scenario design
- **Lack of collaboration** between business and technical teams
- **Maintaining scenarios** as living documentation

## Success Metrics

- Participants can write clear Gherkin scenarios
- Teams can facilitate effective Three Amigos sessions
- Basic BDD automation framework is established
- Scenarios serve as valuable living documentation
- BDD process is integrated into team workflow

## Post-Course Support

- Reference materials for ongoing learning
- Troubleshooting guide for common issues
- Recommended reading and community resources
- Templates for continued practice

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of software development
- Familiarity with user stories concept
- Basic testing knowledge helpful but not required
- Access to text editor (automation setup optional)

## Course Philosophy

- **Practical over theoretical** - focus on hands-on application
- **Collaboration-first** - emphasize team communication
- **Simple before complex** - start with basics, build up
- **Real examples** - use realistic scenarios relevant to teams
- **Iterative learning** - practice, review, improve cycle

## Important Notes

- BDD is about collaboration and communication, not just tools
- Scenarios should be readable by non-technical stakeholders
- Start small and grow BDD practices gradually
- Focus on value delivery over process compliance
- Automation is important but secondary to good scenarios
