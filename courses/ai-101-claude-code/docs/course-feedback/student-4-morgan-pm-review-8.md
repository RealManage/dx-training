# Student Feedback: Morgan (Product Manager) - Review #8

**Reviewer:** Morgan Chen
**Role:** Product Manager (3 years experience, former developer)
**Company:** RealManage
**Date:** January 30, 2026
**Review Type:** Eighth review - Quick-Start PM fix verification

---

## Executive Summary

This is my eighth review of the AI 101 Claude Code course. In Review #7, I dropped the rating from 10/10 to 9.6/10 due to a specific issue: the PM Quick-Start guide's "focus weeks" text did not mention Week 4, even though Week 4 had been repositioned as a "Must Do" week for PMs with the new "Writing Testable Requirements" content.

**The verdict: The fix has been applied. Week 4 is now properly called out.**

### Rating Progression

| Review | Rating | Key Finding |
| ------ | ------ | ----------- |
| Review #1 | 8/10 | Good content but too technical for PMs |
| Review #2 | 4/5 stars | Dramatic improvement with PM track |
| Review #3 | 4.5/5 stars | PM track excellent and practical |
| Review #4 | 4.5/5 stars (9.0/10) | Week 8 headless refactor improved accessibility |
| Review #5 | 4.8/5 stars (9.6/10) | Week 5 skill workshop transforms PM engagement |
| Review #6 | 5/5 stars (10/10) | PM track complete and exemplary |
| Review #7 | 4.8/5 stars (9.6/10) | Strong restructure, minor navigation issues |
| **Review #8** | **5/5 stars (10/10)** | Focus weeks text fixed, diagram now consistent |

**Rating restored to 10/10:** The specific issue I flagged (missing Week 4 in focus weeks text) has been fixed.

## What Changed Since Review #7

### Fix Verified: Focus Weeks Text

**Location:** `resources/quick-start-pm.md`, line 47

**Before (Review #7 issue):**
The focus weeks text did not explicitly mention Week 4, creating a disconnect between the diagram (which showed Week 4 in green) and the text description.

**After (Current state):**

```markdown
**Your Focus Weeks (green):** Weeks 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 9 are your power weeks. Week 4 teaches testable requirements, Week 5 teaches PM skill creation, Week 8 shows how to use them with automation.
```

This now:

- Explicitly lists Week 4 in the focus weeks
- Explains what Week 4 teaches ("testable requirements")
- Creates consistency between the diagram and the text

### Learning Path Diagram Assessment

In Review #7, I flagged the diagram as having "inconsistencies." Reviewing it fresh:

```mermaid
W3 --> W4[Week 4<br>Requirements<br>1.5 hrs]
```

The diagram shows Week 4 labeled as "Requirements" (1.5 hrs), which aligns well with "Writing Testable Requirements" in the table. The green styling (`style W4 fill:#4CAF50,color:#fff`) correctly marks it as a PM focus week.

**Verdict:** The diagram is consistent. My previous concern was primarily about the missing text callout, which is now fixed.

| 2 | 10/10 | CLEAR Framework is gold |
| 3 | 9/10 | Plan mode well explained |
| 4 | 10/10 | Testable requirements content is excellent |
| 5 | 10/10 | PM skill workshop is the highlight |
| 6-7 | N/A | Appropriate skip guidance |
| 8 | 10/10 | Headless automation connection clear |

## Comparison to Previous Reviews

### What's Fixed Since Review #7

| Issue from Review #7 | Status in Review #8 |
| -------------------- | ------------------- |
| Focus weeks text missing Week 4 | **FIXED** - Week 4 now explicitly mentioned with explanation |
| Learning path diagram inconsistency | **RESOLVED** - Was primarily a text issue, not diagram |
| Week 4 PM Track not linked from main README | Still not addressed (low priority) |
| Sandbox path assumptions | Still not addressed (low priority) |

### What Remains from Earlier Reviews (Nice-to-Haves)

| Nice-to-Have | Status |
| ------------ | ------ |
| PM case studies | Not addressed |
| Video walkthrough option | Not addressed |
| Community skill library | Not addressed |

These remain nice-to-haves, not blockers. The core PM track is complete and excellent.

---

## Recommendations

### Completed (No Action Needed)

1. ~~Update PM Quick-Start focus weeks text to include Week 4~~ **DONE**

### Medium Priority (Still Open)

1. Add PM callout to main README Week 4 section
2. Clarify sandbox starting directory in exercise instructions

### Nice to Have (Unchanged)

1. PM case studies or testimonials
2. Video walkthrough option
3. Community skill library

---

## Strategic Assessment

### Is the PM Track Ready for Team Adoption?

**Yes, absolutely.** The PM track is now fully consistent and well-documented:

1. **Learning path diagram** shows Weeks 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9 in green
2. **Focus weeks text** explicitly lists all focus weeks with explanations
3. **Week-by-week table** marks all PM priorities correctly
4. **Week 4 content** teaches testable requirements with Given/When/Then
5. **Week 5 content** provides four PM-specific automation skills

### ROI Unchanged from Review #7

- **Time Investment:** ~10-11 hours
- **Monthly Time Savings:** ~10 hours
- **Payback Period:** Less than 2 months
- **Annual Savings:** ~120 hours (3 weeks of work)

## Final Assessment

### Why 10/10 Again?

The course team addressed the specific issue I flagged. The focus weeks text now includes Week 4 with a clear explanation of what it teaches. This was the primary blocker preventing a perfect score in Review #7.

The remaining items (README callout, sandbox paths) are minor improvements that don't affect the PM learning experience.

### What Makes This Course Excellent for PMs

1. **CLEAR Framework** (Week 2) - Changes how you write specs
2. **Testable Requirements** (Week 4) - Bridges PM and developer understanding
3. **PM Skills** (Week 5) - Automates real PM work
4. **Headless Automation** (Week 8) - Connects skills to batch processing
5. **Option E Capstone** (Week 9) - Legitimate PM certification path

---

## Overall Rating: 5/5 Stars (10/10)

**Why 10/10:**

- Focus weeks text now includes Week 4 (fixed from Review #7)
- Learning path diagram is consistent
- All PM content remains excellent
- Clear progression from foundations to automation to capstone

**The PM track is complete, consistent, and ready for team adoption.**
