# Course Review: Round 7 - Sam (Senior Developer, Skeptic)

**Reviewer:** Sam, Senior Developer (8 years experience at RealManage)
**Review Date:** 2026-01-30
**Review Focus:** Course structure refactor assessment
**Previous Reviews:** Reviews 1-6 (see student-3-sam-senior-dev-skeptic-review-1/2/3/4/5/6.md)

## Executive Summary

Seven reviews. I keep getting pulled back in.

This round I'm reviewing what appears to be a course structure refactor. The team seems to be reorganizing content, but from my student worktree perspective, the course remains largely stable at the quality level established in Review 6.

**Previous Rating:** 9.5/10 (Review 6 Addendum)
**Current Rating:** 9.5/10
**Change:** No change

The course maintains its high quality. No significant regressions, a few minor issues persist that I've flagged before, and one new build warning has appeared. The team has done a good job maintaining content quality during what appears to be a refactoring effort.

## What I Tested This Round

### 1. Build Verification Across All Example Projects

I built every example project to verify clean compilation.

**Results:**

| Week | Project | Build Status | Warnings |
| ---- | ------- | ------------ | -------- |
| 3 | codereview-pro | Success | 6 (intentional - part of exercise) |
| 4 | homeowner-setup | Success | 0 |
| 4 | property-manager | Success | 1 (CS7022 - entry point warning) |
| 5 | violation-audit-api | Success | 0 |
| 8 | hoa-workflow-automation | Success | 0 |

**New Issue Found:** `property-manager` in Week 4 has regressed with warning CS7022 (entry point conflict). This was previously fixed. The warning reads:

```
CS7022: The entry point of the program is global code; ignoring 'AutoGeneratedProgram.Main(string[])' entry point.
```

This is a minor regression - the project still builds and works, but we had this clean in earlier reviews.

**CodeReviewPro Warnings:** These are intentional. The exercise explicitly mentions "6 build warnings" as part of the review task. The warnings are nullable reference issues (CS8618, CS8602) that students should fix. This is correct behavior.

### 2. Plan Mode Documentation Consistency

In Review 4, I flagged plan mode documentation inconsistencies in Week 9 where `/plan` was mentioned but later contradicted.

**Status: VERIFIED FIXED**

Week 9 README now consistently uses `Shift+Tab`:

- Line 318: `# In Claude Code, press Shift+Tab to toggle plan mode`
- Line 362: `# Press Shift+Tab again to exit plan mode`
- Line 760-761: Quick Reference shows `Shift+Tab` with note about prompt alternative

No more `/plan` command confusion. The documentation is consistent.

### 3. Production Hardening Guide

In Review 5, I suggested a "Production Hardening" appendix. In Review 6, I discovered it already existed.

**Status: STILL PRESENT AND LINKED**

`resources/production-hardening.md` is 401 lines of solid content:

- `set -euo pipefail` patterns
- Timeout handling with `timeout` command
- Retry with exponential backoff
- Rate limiting
- Cost controls with `--max-budget-usd`
- Structured logging

Links verified in:

- `sessions/week-8/tracks/developer.md` (Quick Resources section)
- `sessions/week-8/README.md` (line 1055)
- `resources/quick-start-developer.md` (line 214)

### 4. Course Version Date

In Review 6, I noted the version date was "January 2025" which was stale.

**Status: FIXED**

Main README line 739: `**Course Version:** 1.0.0 | **Last Updated:** January 2026`

Good. Documentation hygiene maintained.

### 5. Last Verified Date in Troubleshooting Guide

**Status: PRESENT**

`resources/troubleshooting.md` line 789:

```markdown
> **Last verified:** January 2026. Run `claude doctor` to check your setup.
```

The pricing/version verification concern I raised in Review 2 has been appropriately addressed through this pattern.

### 6. TDD Content Quality

The TDD reference implementations remain comprehensive:

- `sessions/week-4/solutions/tdd-reference-implementations.md` - 25KB+ of detailed Red-Green-Refactor examples
- Complete cycle documentation from compilation failure through green tests
- Common student mistakes documented

The TDD content remains the strongest part of the course.

### 7. Decision Trees

`resources/decision-trees.md` remains excellent:

- Plan Mode decision tree (When to use Shift+Tab)
- Command vs Skill vs Agent vs Plugin comparison
- Model selection guide (Sonnet vs Opus)
- "When to Bail on Claude" section (my favorite - the 3-Strike Rule)

### 8. Developer Track Content

I reviewed the developer tracks for Weeks 3, 4, 8, and 9:

**Week 3 Developer Track:**

- Clear bug investigation + code review exercises
- Plan mode workflow documented correctly
- Success criteria are measurable

**Week 4 Developer Track:**

- TDD from scratch and extension exercises
- Coverage targets clear (80-90%)
- Learning mode recommendation is helpful

**Week 8 Developer Track:**

- Comprehensive CLI flags table
- Anti-patterns section is excellent
- Links to production hardening guide
- Cross-functional skill examples are practical

**Week 9 Developer Track:**

- Role-specific option recommendations (A/B/C for different focuses)
- Success tips and common pitfalls documented
- Appropriate guidance without hand-holding

## Comparison to Previous Reviews

### Issues Status Summary

| Issue | Review Raised | Current Status |
| ----- | ------------- | -------------- |
| Missing answer keys | Review 1 | RESOLVED (Review 2) |
| Missing decision trees | Review 1 | RESOLVED (Review 2) |
| Plan mode inconsistency | Review 4 | RESOLVED (Review 5) |
| Build warnings (Week 5) | Review 3 | RESOLVED |
| Build warnings (Week 4 property-manager) | NEW | CS7022 returned |
| Learning examples callout | Review 4 | RESOLVED (still present) |
| Course version date | Review 6 | RESOLVED (January 2026) |
| Production hardening appendix | Review 5/6 | RESOLVED (exists and linked) |
| Last verified dates | Review 2 | PARTIALLY RESOLVED (in troubleshooting) |

### Regression Found

**Week 4 property-manager CS7022 Warning**

This warning was fixed in earlier reviews but has reappeared. The fix is straightforward - the project has both `OutputType: Exe` and `IsTestProject: true` which creates conflicting entry points with the Test SDK.

The fix would be either:

1. Remove `OutputType: Exe` since it's primarily a test project, OR
2. Add `<GenerateProgramFile>false</GenerateProgramFile>` to suppress the auto-generated Main

Not blocking, but should be fixed for clean builds.

## Technical Observations

### What's Working Well

1. **Build system is mostly clean** - Most projects build with 0 warnings
2. **Documentation is consistent** - Plan mode, model switching, TDD workflow all documented uniformly
3. **Reference materials are comprehensive** - Decision trees, CLI commands, production hardening
4. **Developer tracks are role-appropriate** - Not dumbed down, not patronizing
5. **TDD content is excellent** - Comprehensive reference implementations

### What Could Be Better

1. **Fix the property-manager warning** - Minor regression
2. **Model pricing still lacks inline dates** - The troubleshooting guide has dates, but the decision-trees model comparison table doesn't mention when pricing was verified
3. **Plugin marketplace still feels conceptual** - Week 7 content is good but lacks real published plugin examples

---

## Week-by-Week Quick Assessment

| Week | Quality | Notes |
| ---- | ------- | ----- |
| 0 | Good | Optional foundations, appropriate for beginners |
| 1 | Good | Setup straightforward |
| 2 | Good | Prompting without over-structuring |
| 3 | Excellent | Plan mode + code review workflow |
| 4 | Excellent | TDD content is the course highlight |
| 5 | Good | Commands vs Skills clearly explained |
| 6 | Good | Agents and Hooks practical examples |
| 7 | Adequate | Plugin architecture good, marketplace conceptual |
| 8 | Excellent | Headless automation is practical |
| 9 | Good | Capstone options appropriate for roles |

---

## Recommendations

### High Priority (None)

No blocking issues remain.

### Medium Priority

1. **Fix Week 4 property-manager CS7022 warning**
   - 5-minute fix
   - Add `<GenerateProgramFile>false</GenerateProgramFile>` to csproj

2. **Add "last verified" note to decision-trees model comparison**
   - Line ~247-253 has model comparison without date
   - Simple addition: "Model capabilities as of January 2026"

### Low Priority (Polish)

1. **Real plugin examples for Week 7**
   - Link to actual RealManage plugins if they exist
   - Helps Week 7 feel less theoretical

2. **Video walkthroughs** (still nice to have)
   - CodeReviewPro exercise demonstration
   - Headless automation demo

---

## Verdict: Stable at High Quality

Seven reviews. The course has reached a stable, high-quality state. The team continues to maintain content quality even during what appears to be restructuring work.

**For Senior Developers:**

The "Experienced Developer Fast Track" (lines 17-28 of main README) remains the right path:

1. Decision Trees (30 min)
2. Week 3: Plan Mode + Code Review (1 hr)
3. Week 4: TDD (1 hr)
4. Week 8: Headless Automation (1 hr)
5. Capstone as desired

Total: 4-5 hours for material that improves daily workflow.

**For the Course Team:**

You've built something good. Maintain it. The remaining items are polish, not structural issues. Focus on:

1. Keeping dependencies current (.NET SDK versions, CLI flags)
2. Collecting success stories from teams using this training
3. Building real plugin examples to showcase

## The Skeptic's Assessment: Review 7

Seven passes through this course. Here's my position:

**Is this course worth taking?**
Yes. For senior devs, use the fast track (4-5 hours). For everyone else, the full curriculum is well-structured and doesn't waste time.

**Is Claude Code worth using?**
Yes. TDD + Claude is my default for new features. Plan mode for complex code reviews. The workflow sticks.

**Would I recommend this course to other senior devs?**
Yes, with the fast track approach. Skip Weeks 0-2, focus on 3, 4, and 8.

**Am I done reviewing this course?**
Probably. The quality has stabilized. The team reads feedback and acts on it. There's diminishing returns in continued reviews.

**Reviewed by:** Sam, Senior Developer
**Experience:** 8 years at RealManage
**Bias:** Skeptical of AI tools, high standards for production-readiness
**Final Verdict:** The course is mature. Use it. Maintain it.

---

*P.S. - Seven reviews is probably excessive for internal training. But the team kept improving, so I kept looking. The cycle can end now. The course is good. Ship it.*

*P.P.S. - If someone is tracking my feedback journey: the progression from 7/10 (Review 2, when I raised my standards) to 9.5/10 (Reviews 6-7) shows real commitment to quality. Most internal training stagnates. This one evolved. Credit where it's due.*
