# FAQ for Skeptics

We get it. You've seen "transformational initiatives" before. You've tried AI tools that didn't live up to the hype. You're busy shipping features and don't have time for the latest fad.

Here are honest answers to the questions you're probably asking.

---

## "Why is this necessary? I'm already productive."

**Fair point.** You might be productive, and this training won't make you worse at your job.

But here's what we've seen: engineers who use AI tools effectively are catching bugs earlier, spending less time on boilerplate, and getting through code reviews faster. Not magic - just better tools.

If you're already using AI effectively, you'll move through the content faster and can help teammates along the way.

---

## "Will this affect my job?"

**No.** AI tools don't replace developers, QA engineers, or PMs. They amplify what you do.

- AI can generate code, but can't understand your domain
- AI can suggest tests, but can't decide what's important to test
- AI can draft stories, but can't talk to customers

The teams getting the most value from AI have strong humans guiding it. That's you.

---

## "What if the tool doesn't work for my use case?"

**Then say so.** We want honest feedback.

Not every tool works for every situation. If you try something and it's useless:

1. Try a few different approaches (sometimes it's the prompt)
2. Ask in #ai-exchange if others have cracked it
3. If it just doesn't work, share that - it's useful information

We'd rather know "AI doesn't help with database migrations" than pretend it's perfect for everything.

---

## "I tried GitHub Copilot and it was meh."

**Different tools are different.** Copilot is autocomplete. Claude Code is more like a pair programmer you can have a conversation with.

Give it a fair shot with proper training. If you still find it underwhelming for your work, that feedback is valuable.

---

## "The 'mandatory' framing bothers me."

**We hear you.** Let's reframe: AI fluency is an expected skill, like knowing Git or writing tests. We're providing structured training and support to help you get there.

If that still feels heavy, talk to us. We're not trying to force anything - we're trying to ensure everyone has the same opportunities.

---

## "How much time will this take?"

**2 hours per week** for group sessions, plus self-paced learning at your own pace.

- Group session time is protected
- Self-paced work fits around your schedule
- Extended timelines available if you need them

We've tried to make this as minimally disruptive as possible.

---

## "What if I fall behind?"

**That's fine.** Let your trainer know. Extended timelines are available, no questions asked.

The goal is competence, not speed. Some people need more time than others, and that's okay.

---

## "This feels like surveillance."

**It's not meant to.** Here's what we track and why:

| What We Track | Why |
| ------------- | --- |
| Training completion | To know who might need extra support |
| Artifacts created | To measure if AI reviews actually catch bugs |
| Satisfaction surveys | To improve the program |

We're not tracking how you spend your time or reporting to your manager about your progress. We're trying to measure whether this investment is paying off.

---

## "I've seen initiatives like this fail before."

**So have we.** That's why we designed this differently:

- **No arbitrary deadlines** - Take the time you need
- **Role-specific content** - QA and PMs have their own tracks
- **Outcome metrics** - We're measuring if it actually helps, not just if people comply
- **Group learning** - Everyone learns together, experienced users help others
- **Honest feedback welcome** - Tell us what doesn't work

If this becomes bureaucratic checkbox theater, we want to know so we can fix it.

---

## "What's in it for me?"

Honestly:

- **Less tedious work** - AI handles boilerplate so you do interesting stuff
- **Faster code reviews** - Get useful feedback in seconds, not hours
- **Catch bugs earlier** - AI notices things humans miss
- **Career skill** - AI fluency is becoming table stakes in the industry

Maybe you'll love it. Maybe you'll find it marginally useful. Maybe it won't work for your specific workflow. We'd rather you find out with proper training than dismiss it without trying.

---

## "What if I have more concerns?"

**Talk to us.** Seriously.

- DM any trainer
- Post in #ai-exchange
- Talk to your manager
- Anonymous feedback survey (link in #ai-exchange)

Skepticism is healthy. We'd rather work through your concerns than have you silently resent the program.

---

## Still Skeptical?

That's okay. Give it an honest try. If it doesn't work for you after training, we want to know why.

The goal isn't 100% AI enthusiasm. The goal is informed decisions about when AI helps and when it doesn't.
