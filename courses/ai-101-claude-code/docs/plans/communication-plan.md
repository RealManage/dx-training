# AI Skills Development Program - Communication Plan

## Overview

Clear, supportive communication ensures everyone understands the program, feels included, and knows where to get help.

## Channels

| Channel | Purpose | Audience |
| ------- | ------- | -------- |
| #development | Major announcements | All engineering |
| #ai-exchange | Daily tips, Q&A, huddles, support | AI learners |
| Teams meetings | Group training sessions | Group members |
| Email | Scheduling, certifications | All participants |

## Key Messages

### For Everyone

> "We're investing in your growth with AI skills training. This isn't about replacing you - it's about giving you powerful new tools. We'll support you throughout the journey, whatever pace you need."

### For Managers

> "Your team members will have protected time for AI training. Please support their attendance and celebrate their progress. The goal is competence, not speed - some people will need more time than others, and that's fine."

### For Skeptics

> "We hear you. Not every tool works for every situation, and that's okay to say. We want honest feedback about what works and what doesn't. Skeptics who give AI a fair shot often become the best at knowing when to use it - and when not to."

## FAQ for Skeptics

Address common concerns directly. Post in #ai-exchange and link from announcements.

### "Why is this necessary? I'm already productive."

Fair question. You might already be productive, and this training won't make you worse at your job. But AI tools can:

- Handle the tedious parts of your work (boilerplate, repetitive refactoring)
- Catch bugs you might miss (especially edge cases)
- Speed up code reviews significantly

If you're already using AI effectively, you'll move through the content faster and can help teammates along the way.

### "Will this affect my job?"

No. AI tools don't replace developers, QA engineers, or PMs. They amplify what you do.

- AI can generate code, but can't understand your domain
- AI can suggest tests, but can't decide what's important
- AI can draft stories, but can't talk to customers

The teams getting the most value have strong humans guiding the AI. That's you.

### "What if the tool doesn't work for my use case?"

Then say so! We want honest feedback about what works and what doesn't. Not every tool is right for every situation.

Everyone is encouraged to share limitations they discover. We'd rather know "this doesn't work for database migrations" than pretend it's perfect.

### "The mandatory framing bothers me."

We hear you. Let's reframe: AI fluency is an expected skill, like knowing Git or writing tests. We're providing structured training and support to help you get there.

If "expected" still feels heavy - we're happy to discuss. DM any trainer.

## Manager Talking Points

For 1:1s and team discussions:

### When someone is worried about time commitment

"Training is protected time - it's not competing with sprint work. We've communicated to leadership that velocity may dip slightly during training, and that's expected."

### When someone is struggling

"Extended timelines are available - just let the trainer know. There's no penalty for needing more time. 1:1 coaching is available too."

### When someone is skeptical

"Give it a fair shot. If specific use cases don't work, we want that feedback. Skeptics who actually try the tools often become the best at knowing when to use them."

### When someone asks about career impact

"Certification goes on your record as a positive - it shows you invested in learning new skills. There's no negative impact for people who need more time to complete."
