# AI Skills Development Program - Communication Plan

## Overview

Clear, supportive communication ensures everyone understands the program, feels included, and knows where to get help.

## Channels

| Channel | Purpose | Audience |
|---------|---------|----------|
| #development | Major announcements | All engineering |
| #ai-exchange | Daily tips, Q&A, huddles, support | AI learners |
| Teams meetings | Group training sessions | Group members |
| Email | Scheduling, certifications | All participants |

## Key Messages

### For Everyone

> "We're investing in your growth with AI skills training. This isn't about replacing you - it's about giving you powerful new tools. We'll support you throughout the journey, whatever pace you need."

### For Managers

> "Your team members will have protected time for AI training. Please support their attendance and celebrate their progress. The goal is competence, not speed - some people will need more time than others, and that's fine."

### For Skeptics

> "We hear you. Not every tool works for every situation, and that's okay to say. We want honest feedback about what works and what doesn't. Skeptics who give AI a fair shot often become the best at knowing when to use it - and when not to."

🚀 AI Skills Development Program

Team,

We're investing in everyone's growth with structured AI skills training.

What this means for you:
• Dedicated training time - protected calendar blocks, not competing with sprint work
• Role-specific content - Developers, QA/Support, and PMs each have tailored tracks
• Peer support - Early Adopters and the DX Team to help when you're stuck
• No rush - We care about competence, not speed. Extended timelines available.

What this ISN'T:
• A test of your worth
• Competition with your teammates
• Something that will replace you

AI tools amplify what you already do. The teams getting the most value have strong humans guiding them. That's you.

Getting started:
1. Watch #ai-exchange for your group assignment
2. Ensure Claude Code is installed (DX can help)
3. Check out the course preview: [AI 101 - Claude Code](https://gitlab.com/therealmanage/tools/dx/dx-training/-/tree/main/courses/ai-101-claude-code)

Questions? Concerns? Drop them in #ai-exchange or DM any trainer. There are no dumb questions.

- DX Team

## CTO Message (Week 0)

**Email from JZ:**

```
Subject: Why I'm Excited About Our AI Skills Program

Team,

I want to share why we're investing in AI skills training for everyone.

Over the past year, I've watched some of our engineers dramatically increase their productivity with AI tools. Code reviews that used to take hours now take minutes. Test coverage is improving. People are spending more time on interesting problems.

But I've also noticed not everyone has had time to explore these tools. That's not fair - everyone should have access to these productivity gains.

This program ensures everyone gets:
- Structured time to learn (protected from sprint work)
- Support from trainers and Early Adopters who've been through training
- Content tailored to your role (developers, QA, and PMs each have their own track)

I'm not asking anyone to blindly trust that AI is magic. I'm asking you to give it a fair shot with proper training and support. If it doesn't work for certain use cases, tell us - that feedback makes the program better.

Looking forward to seeing what you all build.

JZ

## FAQ for Skeptics

Address common concerns directly. Post in #ai-exchange and link from announcements.

### "Why is this necessary? I'm already productive."

Fair question. You might already be productive, and this training won't make you worse at your job. But AI tools can:

- Handle the tedious parts of your work (boilerplate, repetitive refactoring)
- Catch bugs you might miss (especially edge cases)
- Speed up code reviews significantly

If you're already using AI effectively, you'll move through the content faster and can help teammates along the way.

### "Will this affect my job?"

No. AI tools don't replace developers, QA engineers, or PMs. They amplify what you do.

- AI can generate code, but can't understand your domain
- AI can suggest tests, but can't decide what's important
- AI can draft stories, but can't talk to customers

The teams getting the most value have strong humans guiding the AI. That's you.

### "What if the tool doesn't work for my use case?"

Then say so! We want honest feedback about what works and what doesn't. Not every tool is right for every situation.

Everyone is encouraged to share limitations they discover. We'd rather know "this doesn't work for database migrations" than pretend it's perfect.

### "The mandatory framing bothers me."

We hear you. Let's reframe: AI fluency is an expected skill, like knowing Git or writing tests. We're providing structured training and support to help you get there.

If "expected" still feels heavy - we're happy to discuss. DM any trainer.

## Manager Talking Points

For 1:1s and team discussions:

### When someone is worried about time commitment

"Training is protected time - it's not competing with sprint work. We've communicated to leadership that velocity may dip slightly during training, and that's expected."

### When someone is struggling

"Extended timelines are available - just let the trainer know. There's no penalty for needing more time. 1:1 coaching is available too."

### When someone is skeptical

"Give it a fair shot. If specific use cases don't work, we want that feedback. Skeptics who actually try the tools often become the best at knowing when to use them."

### When someone asks about career impact

"Certification goes on your record as a positive - it shows you invested in learning new skills. There's no negative impact for people who need more time to complete."
