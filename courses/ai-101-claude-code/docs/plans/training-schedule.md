- Self-paced exercises and practice on your own schedule

**Friday session time is protected.** Managers have been informed that this is dedicated learning time.

## Trainers

DX Team members lead all training sessions.

Trainers will:

- Lead live coding demonstrations
- Answer questions and troubleshoot
- Review submitted work
- Provide 1:1 support for anyone struggling

## Participant Expectations

- **Attend Friday sessions** when possible (notify trainer if you can't)
- **Complete setup** before first session
- **Participate** in hands-on exercises
- **Ask questions** - there are no dumb questions

## If You Miss a Session

Life happens. Here's how to catch up:

### Makeup Sessions (Preferred)

**Mid-week makeup sessions** are available Tuesday or Wednesday for anyone who missed Friday:

1. DM a trainer to schedule
2. Complete before the next Friday group session
3. Same content, smaller group

### Self-Paced Catch-up

If makeup sessions don't work:

1. **Watch the recording** (posted in #ai-exchange)
2. **Complete the exercises** at your own pace
3. **DM a trainer** if you're stuck

**No penalty** - we care about learning, not attendance perfection

## Need More Time?

**Extended timelines are available.** Just let your trainer know.

| Situation | What to Do |
|-----------|------------|
| Falling behind | DM trainer for 1:1 catch-up |
| Heavy sprint | Coordinate with manager for protected time |
| Not clicking yet | More exercises, different explanations available |
| Personal situation | Take what time you need, no questions asked |

The goal is competence, not speed.
