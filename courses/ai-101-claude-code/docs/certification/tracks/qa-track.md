# QA Engineer Certification Track

## Overview

The QA track teaches you to use AI for testing workflows: generating test cases, analyzing bugs, creating test data, and improving test automation.

**You don't need to be a developer to succeed in this track.**

## Track Duration

**6-7 weeks typical**

| Phase | Weeks | Focus |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Foundations | 0-3 | Setup, prompting, AI basics |
| QA-Specific | 4-6 | Test case generation, bug analysis, automation |
| Capstone | 7 | Demonstrate AI-assisted testing |

## Week-by-Week Content

### Week 0: AI Foundations (Optional)

- What AI can and can't do
- How language models work
- Setting expectations

### Week 1: Setup & Orientation

- Install Claude Code

### Week 2: Prompting Foundations

- Writing effective prompts
- Context and specificity
- Iterating on results

### Week 3: Planning & Analysis

- Breaking down complex problems
- Using AI for research
- Analyzing code for testability

### Week 4: Test Case Generation

**QA-Specific Content:**

- Generating test cases from requirements
- Edge case identification
- Test scenario expansion
- Coverage matrix creation

**Exercises:**

- Generate test cases for a user story
- Identify edge cases for a payment flow
- Create a test matrix for a feature

### Week 5: Bug Analysis & Triage

**QA-Specific Content:**

- Analyzing bug reports with AI
- Pattern identification across bugs
- Root cause hypothesis generation
- Writing better bug reports

**Exercises:**

- Analyze a set of bug reports for patterns
- Generate reproduction steps from vague reports
- Suggest root causes for a failing test

### Week 6: Test Automation Assistance

**QA-Specific Content:**

- Using AI to write test automation scripts
- Converting manual test cases to automated
- Improving existing test code
- Test data generation

**Exercises:**

- Convert manual test to automated script
- Generate test data for specific scenarios
- Improve an existing test's assertions

### Week 7: Capstone

Demonstrate AI fluency with a real project:

- Generate a test suite for a feature
- Analyze a set of bugs
- Create test automation for a workflow

## What You'll Be Able to Do

After completing this track:

- [ ] Generate test cases from requirements quickly
- [ ] Identify edge cases you might have missed
- [ ] Analyze bug reports for patterns
- [ ] Create test data for various scenarios
- [ ] Write better, more detailed bug reports
- [ ] Assist with test automation scripts
- [ ] Know when AI helps and when it doesn't

## Capstone Requirements

Submit one of the following:

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Test Suite | Generate a comprehensive test suite for a feature |
| Bug Analysis | Analyze 10+ bugs, identify patterns, suggest improvements |
| Automation | Convert manual tests to automated scripts with AI assistance |

## This Track Is For You If

- You do manual or automated testing
- You write bug reports and test plans
- You want to generate test cases faster
- You're curious how AI can help QA work

## This Track Isn't About

- Replacing QA engineers with AI
- Writing production code (that's the developer track)
- Pretending AI is perfect for everything

## Differences from Developer Track

| Topic | Developer Track | QA Track |
| ----- | --------------- | -------- |
| Week 4 | TDD (writing code) | Test case generation |
| Week 5 | Commands & Skills | Bug analysis & triage |
| Week 6 | Agents & Hooks | Test automation assistance |
| Capstone | Code project | Test suite or bug analysis |

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need to know how to code?**
A: Basic familiarity with code helps but isn't required. The track focuses on testing workflows, not production development.

**Q: Can I do the developer track instead?**
A: If you write code regularly, yes. But the QA track is specifically designed for testing workflows.

**Q: What if I do both manual and automated testing?**
A: Great! The track covers both. Focus on whichever is more relevant to your daily work.

**Q: Will AI replace QA engineers?**
A: No. AI can generate test cases, but it can't decide what's important to test. It can find patterns in bugs, but it can't understand user impact. QA judgment remains essential.
