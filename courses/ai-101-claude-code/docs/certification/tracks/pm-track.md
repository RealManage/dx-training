These skills are available after training and can be customized for your team's formats.

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need to know how to code?**
A: No. The track focuses on product workflows, not development.

**Q: Can I do the developer track instead?**
A: If you write code regularly, yes. But the PM track is specifically designed for product work.

**Q: What if I used to be a developer?**
A: The PM track will be more relevant to your current role. You can always explore developer content after completing the PM track.

**Q: Will AI replace PMs?**
A: No. AI can draft stories and specs, but it can't talk to customers, understand user needs, or make product decisions. Your judgment remains essential.
