## Quick Reference

| Channel | Use For |

| **Office Hours** | Live help (schedule posted in #ai-exchange) |

## Slack: #ai-exchange

Your primary support channel. Use it for:

- Questions about course content
- Sharing what's working (and what isn't)
- Connecting with other learners
- Getting help from Early Adopters and trainers

> **Tip:** No question is too basic. If you're wondering, someone else probably is too.

## DM Any Trainer

For private conversations:

- Need more time? Just ask.
- Struggling with a specific concept? We'll help.
- Personal concerns about the training? We're here.

**Trainers:** Cal and the DX Team

## Office Hours

Drop-in sessions for live help. Schedule posted in #ai-exchange.

*Remember: We care about competence, not speed. Take the time you need.*
