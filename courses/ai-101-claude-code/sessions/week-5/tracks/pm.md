# Week 5: Commands & Basic Skills - PM Track

## This Week is Optional for PMs

Week 5 covers the technical implementation of commands and skills - creating `.md` files, YAML frontmatter, and directory structures. This is primarily developer-focused content.

## What You Can Skip

- Part 1: Creating Slash Commands (technical implementation)
- Part 2: Creating Skills (technical implementation)
- Part 3: Hands-On Exercises (coding exercises)

## What You Should Know (5 min read)

### The Big Picture

**Commands** and **Skills** are reusable automation that developers create. Think of them as "saved prompts" that anyone on the team can run.

**Commands** = Simple prompts
- Example: `/late-fee 500 3` calculates late fees for $500 over 3 months

**Skills** = Commands + supporting files
- Example: `/violation-report 12345` generates a report using templates and business rules

### Why This Matters for Product

1. **Standardization** - Teams use the same commands = consistent output
2. **Efficiency** - Complex workflows reduced to one-liners
3. **Knowledge capture** - Business rules encoded in prompts
4. **Onboarding** - New team members get productive faster

### Example Use Cases

| Command/Skill | What It Does | Business Value |
|---------------|--------------|----------------|
| `/violation-report` | Generates full violation report | Saves 30 min per report |
| `/late-fee` | Calculates compound interest | Eliminates calculation errors |
| `/board-summary` | Creates board meeting summary | Standardizes board packets |

## Recommended for PMs

### Option A: Observe a Developer Session (30 min)

Sit in on a developer's Week 5 session to see:
- How commands are created
- How skills differ from commands
- What's possible to automate

### Option B: Review Existing Commands (15 min)

Ask your team:
- What commands exist in your projects?
- Which commands save the most time?
- What new commands would be valuable?

### Option C: Skip to Week 6 Prep

Week 6 covers Agents & Hooks, which has more PM-relevant content:
- Custom AI assistants for specific tasks
- Compliance and audit logging
- Permission controls

---

## Questions to Bring to Week 6

As you think about Week 6 (Agents & Hooks), consider:

1. **What tasks require human oversight?** (Hooks can add approval steps)
2. **What operations need audit trails?** (Hooks can log everything)
3. **What specialized AI assistants would help?** (Agents can be domain-specific)

---

## Homework (PM Track)

1. **Talk to your developers** - Ask what commands they've created or want to create
2. **Identify 2-3 workflows** that could benefit from standardized commands
3. **Prepare for Week 6** - Think about compliance and audit requirements

---

## See You in Week 6

Week 6: Agents & Hooks covers:
- Custom subagents (specialized AI assistants)
- Lifecycle hooks (automated logging, validation, blocking)
- SOC 2 compliance patterns

This content has more direct PM relevance for:
- Compliance requirements
- Workflow approvals
- Audit trail needs
