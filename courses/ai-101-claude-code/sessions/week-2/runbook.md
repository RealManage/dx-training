## Instructor Notes

### Common Issues & Solutions

> **"Should I use XML tags?"**

- Probably not! Natural language works great
- Show them your actual successful prompts (no XML)
- Demonstrate conversation style gets same results

> **"My prompts feel too casual"**

- That's perfect! Claude responds well to natural language
- Formal structure often makes things harder
- Show examples of chatty prompts that work great

> **"Generated tests are too simple"**

- Explicitly request edge cases
- Specify coverage percentage
- Provide example test scenarios

### Time Management Tips

- Part 1: Critical foundation - don't rush
- Part 3: Heart of the session - full 60 min
- If running late: Skip Part 4.2 (personal customization)
- Always leave 5 min for Q&A

### Engagement Strategies

- Use real code from RealManage projects
- Have participants share prompts in chat
- Celebrate "aha moments" when prompts improve
- Do live demonstrations with participant suggestions

### Assessment

Quick check at end:

1. Show a vague prompt - have them improve it naturally
2. What makes a prompt clear and specific?
3. When is structure actually helpful (vs just talking)?
4. What's the minimum test coverage requirement?
