## Tips for Better Prompts

1. **Be specific about emotion** - "frustrated about surprise charges" vs just "upset"
2. **Include relevant numbers** - Amounts, dates, timelines
3. **Specify tone** - Empathetic, matter-of-fact, firm but fair
4. **Set length constraints** - "Under 150 words" keeps responses focused
5. **Ask for structure** - "Include: acknowledgment, explanation, next steps"
