## Using Checklists with Claude

**Prompt pattern:**

```text
Before I draft this response, help me define success criteria.

Situation: [DESCRIBE THE TICKET]

What should a successful response include for:
1. Completeness (what must be answered?)
2. Tone (what's appropriate here?)
3. Accuracy (what facts must be correct?)
4. Actionability (what should they do next?)

Give me a checklist I can use to "test" my response.
```

**After drafting:**

```text
Review this response against our criteria:
[PASTE CRITERIA]

Response:
[PASTE RESPONSE]

Does it pass all requirements? What's missing?
```
