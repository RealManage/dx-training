# Response Criteria - TDD Thinking for Support

## Context

This environment applies **Test-Driven Development** thinking to support responses. Just like developers write tests before code, you'll define success criteria before drafting responses.

## The TDD Parallel

| Development TDD | Support TDD |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| Write failing test | Define acceptance criteria |
| Write minimal code to pass | Draft response to meet criteria |
| Run test to verify | Check response against criteria |
| Refactor if needed | Revise if criteria not met |

## Why Define Criteria First?

Without criteria:

- Responses miss important elements
- Quality is inconsistent
- Review is subjective ("this feels good")

With criteria:

- Every response covers required elements
- Quality is measurable
- Review is objective ("does it pass?")

## Practice Tasks

1. Review quality checklists in `quality-checklist.md`
2. Apply criteria-first approach to scenarios
3. "Test" your responses against defined criteria
4. Iterate until all criteria pass
