# Developer Track - Capstone Guidance

## Recommended Options

| Your Focus | Recommended Option | Why |
| ---------- | ------------------ | --- |
| Backend/API | **Option A**: Violation Escalation | State machines, event-driven architecture, complex business logic |
| Full-Stack | **Option B**: Knowledge Base | End-to-end feature with C# API + Angular frontend |
| Data/Analytics | **Option C**: Financial Forecasting | Data analysis, predictions, reporting pipelines |

## What to Expect

### Option A: Violation Escalation System

**Best for:** Backend developers who enjoy complex business logic

You'll build:

- State machine for violation lifecycle (30/60/90 day progression)
- Event-driven notification system
- Compound interest calculation (10% monthly)
- Audit trail for SOC 2 compliance

**Skills You'll Use:**

- Week 4: TDD with complex state transitions
- Week 5: Custom skills for automation
- Week 6: Hooks and agents for workflow
- Week 7: Plugin patterns for reusable components
- Week 8: Headless automation

### Option B: Self-Service Knowledge Base

**Best for:** Full-stack developers who enjoy user-facing features

You'll build:

- C# Web API with search endpoints
- Angular 17 frontend with search UI
- AI-powered search using Claude
- Analytics dashboard

**Skills You'll Use:**

- Week 3: Plan Mode for architecture
- Week 4: TDD for both backend and frontend
- Week 6: Sub-agent patterns for parallel searches
- Week 8: Cost tracking and optimization

### Option C: Financial Forecasting Tool

**Best for:** Data-focused developers who enjoy analytics

You'll build:

- Historical data analysis service
- Prediction algorithms with confidence intervals
- Automated report generation
- Board meeting integration

**Skills You'll Use:**

- Week 3: Plan Mode for data modeling
- Week 4: TDD for prediction accuracy
- Week 7: Plugin patterns for automation
- Week 8: Batch automation for scheduled reports

## Getting Started

1. Choose your option based on your interests
2. Copy the starter template to your sandbox
3. Use Plan Mode to design your architecture
4. Follow TDD religiously (Red-Green-Refactor)
5. Build your custom skill early
6. Add hooks for audit logging

## Success Tips

- **Start with tests**: Write tests before implementation
- **MVP first**: Get the happy path working, then add edge cases
- **Ask Claude**: Use Claude Code to help with complex logic
- **Document as you go**: Keep CLAUDE.md updated
- **Watch the clock**: Leave 10 min for demo prep

## Common Pitfalls

- Over-engineering the solution
- Skipping tests to "save time" (this backfires)
- Forgetting to add the custom skill
- Not testing hooks before demo
