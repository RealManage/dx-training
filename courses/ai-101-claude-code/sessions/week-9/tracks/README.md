# Capstone Track Guidance

Choose the track that matches your role for role-specific guidance on which capstone option to select.

## Available Tracks

| Track | File | Recommended Options |
|-------|------|---------------------|
| **Developer** | [developer.md](./developer.md) | Options A, B, C |
| **QA Engineer** | [qa.md](./qa.md) | Option D |
| **Product Manager** | [pm.md](./pm.md) | Option E |
| **Support** | [support.md](./support.md) | Option F |

## Quick Reference

### Coding Tracks (Requires Development Skills)

- **Option A: Violation Escalation System** - Backend focus, state machines, business logic
- **Option B: Self-Service Knowledge Base** - Full-stack, C# API + Angular frontend
- **Option C: Financial Forecasting Tool** - Data focus, analytics, reporting
- **Option D: Test Automation Suite** - QA focus, test frameworks, CI/CD

### Non-Coding Tracks (Documentation Focus)

- **Option E: Product Design & Documentation** - PRDs, user stories, stakeholder docs
- **Option F: Knowledge Base & Response Templates** - FAQs, templates, support tools

## Not Sure Which to Choose?

Ask yourself:

1. **Do you write code daily?** -> Developer track (A, B, or C)
2. **Is testing your primary focus?** -> QA track (D)
3. **Do you define products and requirements?** -> PM track (E)
4. **Do you support customers?** -> Support track (F)

## Cross-Functional Teams

If you're working in a team with mixed roles:

- Developers can pair with PMs on Option E (PM writes stories, Dev reviews for feasibility)
- QA can pair with Developers on any coding option (QA writes tests, Dev writes implementation)
- Support can pair with PMs on Option F (Support provides real scenarios, PM structures content)
