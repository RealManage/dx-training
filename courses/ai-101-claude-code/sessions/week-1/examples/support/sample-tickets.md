Use these realistic ticket scenarios to practice with Claude Code. Copy a scenario into your prompt and ask Claude to help draft a response.

## Ticket 1: First-Time Violation - Frustrated Resident

**From:** Martha Johnson (Unit 4521)
**Subject:** Unfair Violation Notice!!!

I just got a violation notice in the mail saying my trash cans were visible from the street. This is absolutely ridiculous! I put them out the night before pickup like everyone else does. I've lived here for 8 years and never had a problem. Why am I being targeted now? I want this removed from my record immediately.

**Practice prompt:**

```text
Draft a response to this resident who received a first-time violation for visible trash cans. She's upset and feels targeted. Be empathetic but explain the policy.
```

## Ticket 2: Late Fee Confusion

**From:** Robert Chen (Unit 2203)
**Subject:** Question about my balance

Hi, I'm looking at my account and I'm confused. My quarterly dues are $450 but my balance shows $542.85. I thought I was only one month late? Can someone explain where this number comes from? I want to pay but I need to understand the charges first.

**Practice prompt:**

```text
This resident is confused about late fees on their account. Their $450 dues have grown to $542.85. Explain how the fees accumulated and offer options for payment.
```

## Ticket 3: Appeal Request

**From:** David & Sarah Martinez (Unit 1847)
**Subject:** Appealing our landscaping fine

We received a $100 fine for "dead grass" but we've been dealing with a broken sprinkler system. We had a repair scheduled but the company canceled twice. We finally got it fixed last week and the grass is already recovering. We have receipts from the sprinkler company showing the repair dates. Can we appeal this fine? We feel it's unfair since we were actively trying to fix the problem.

**Practice prompt:**

```text
Draft a response to residents appealing a landscaping fine. They have documentation showing they were trying to fix the issue. Explain the appeal process and what they need to submit.
```

## Ticket 4: New Resident Questions

**From:** Jennifer Park (Unit 3302)
**Subject:** Just moved in - questions!

Hi! We just closed on our townhouse last week and we're excited to be part of the community. I have a few questions:

1. When are HOA dues due and how do I pay?
2. Is there a resident portal I should sign up for?
3. We want to paint our front door - do we need approval?
4. Where can I find the community rules?

Thanks for your help!

**Practice prompt:**

```text
Draft a welcome response for a new resident with multiple questions about dues, the portal, architectural changes, and community rules. Be friendly and thorough.
```

## Ticket 5: Escalation - Repeat Offender

**From:** Internal Note (Unit 892 - Thomas Wright)
**Subject:** 90-day violation - needs final notice

This is the third notice for Mr. Wright regarding his RV parked in the driveway. First notice sent 90 days ago, second notice at 60 days. No response to either. Board has approved proceeding with final notice and potential legal action if not resolved within 14 days.

**Practice prompt:**

```text
Draft the final escalation notice for a resident who has ignored two previous violation notices about an RV in the driveway. This is the 90-day notice. Be firm but professional, and mention next steps if not resolved.
```

## How to Use These Scenarios

1. **Read the ticket** - Understand the situation and the resident's tone
2. **Draft with Claude** - Use the practice prompt or write your own
3. **Review the response** - Is it accurate? Empathetic? Complete?
4. **Iterate** - Ask Claude to adjust tone, add details, or shorten
5. **Save good ones** - Build your personal template library

## Tips for Real Tickets

- **Match the tone** - Upset residents need empathy first, then facts
- **Be specific** - Reference actual policy sections when possible
- **Offer next steps** - Always tell them what to do next
- **Keep it concise** - Residents don't read long emails
- **Proofread** - Claude drafts well, but always review before sending
