# Support Team Practice Sandbox

This folder is your practice environment for the AI-101 Support Track.

## What's Here

- **CLAUDE.md** - Pre-configured context file that tells Claude about HOA support work
- Response templates and policy information already loaded

## How to Use

From the repository root, run these commands:

```bash
# Navigate to the support example folder
cd courses/ai-101-claude-code/sessions/week-1/examples/support

# Start Claude Code
claude
```

That's it! Claude will automatically read the CLAUDE.md file and understand your HOA support context.
