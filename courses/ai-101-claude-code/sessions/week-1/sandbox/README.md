# Sandbox - Your Practice Space 🏖️

This is YOUR space to experiment with Claude Code!

## What's Here?

A simple C# CLI application for managing HOA violations. It's intentionally incomplete and has some bugs - perfect for practicing with Claude Code!

## How to Use

1. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

2. **Explore with Claude:**
   ```bash
   claude
   ```

3. **Try these prompts:**
   - "Explain how this top-level program works"
   - "Fix the fine calculation bug"
   - "Implement the missing menu options"
   - "Add async/await patterns"
   - "Create unit tests"

## Rules

1. **Modify anything** - This is meant for experimentation
2. **Break things** - That's how you learn!
3. **Ask Claude for help** - Practice your prompting
4. **Don't commit changes** - Keep your experiments local

## Reset Your Sandbox

If you want to start fresh:
```bash
git checkout -- sandbox/
```

## Modern C# Features Used

- **Top-level programs** - No Main() method needed!
