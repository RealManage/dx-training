# Complex Tickets for Plan Mode Practice

These scenarios require structured thinking before responding.

## Ticket 1: The Multi-Issue Cascade

**From:** Angela Morrison (Unit 2847)
**Subject:** MULTIPLE PROBLEMS - NEED HELP NOW

I am SO frustrated with this community. Let me list everything:

1. I got a violation notice for "unapproved paint color" but I used the EXACT color from the approved list. I have the receipt from Sherwin Williams!

2. My February dues payment apparently didn't go through, but my bank shows it was sent. Now you're charging me late fees?!

3. The pool has been closed for THREE WEEKS. When is it reopening? We pay dues for amenities we can't use!

4. Also, my neighbor's dog barks all night. Can the HOA do anything about this?

I need answers TODAY. I'm considering not paying any more dues until these issues are resolved.

**Planning Prompts:**

```
Help me plan a response to this multi-issue ticket.

First, identify:
1. All separate issues mentioned
2. Which I can resolve directly
3. Which need research or escalation
4. The order I should address them
5. How to handle the "not paying dues" threat

Then suggest a response structure.
```

## Ticket 2: The Emotional Escalation

**From:** Marcus Thompson (Unit 1523)
**Subject:** I'M DONE - CALLING MY LAWYER

THIS IS THE LAST STRAW!!!

I have paid my dues ON TIME for 12 YEARS. Then ONE month I'm a few days late because of a family emergency (my mother was in the hospital) and you people slap me with a $75 late fee???

This is PREDATORY. This is HARASSMENT. I am contacting:

- My lawyer
- The local news
- The Better Business Bureau
- The state attorney general

You have until Friday to remove this fee or I will pursue LEGAL ACTION.

---

**Planning Prompts:**

```
This customer is very upset and making legal threats. Help me plan my approach:

1. What emotions do I need to acknowledge?
2. What facts do I need to gather about this account?
3. Do the legal threats require escalation?
4. What resolution options do I have (given 12 years of on-time payments)?
5. How do I respond to the threat without being defensive?
6. What's my de-escalation strategy?
```

## Ticket 3: The Policy Edge Case

**From:** Sarah Chen (Unit 3301)
**Subject:** Request for accommodation

Hello,

I recently became disabled and now use a wheelchair. I need to install a ramp at my front entrance for accessibility.

I know exterior modifications require approval, but this is a medical necessity. My doctor has provided documentation.

Additionally, I may need to widen my garage door in the future for my accessible van.

What is the process for ADA accommodations? How long does approval take? I need the ramp installed within the next 2-3 weeks.

---

**Planning Prompts:**

```
This involves ADA/accessibility accommodations. Plan my response:

1. What are the legal requirements around disability accommodations?
2. Who needs to be involved in this approval?
3. What documentation should I request?
4. What's a realistic timeline I can commit to?
5. What should I NOT say (legal risk)?
6. How do I expedite this appropriately?
```

## Ticket 4: The Cross-Department Puzzle

**From:** Internal Transfer from Accounting
**Subject:** FW: Payment dispute - needs support follow-up

Accounting received a check for $450 from Robert Williams (Unit 892) with a note saying "Dues ONLY - NOT authorizing any fees."

His account shows:

- Outstanding balance: $687.50
- Original dues: $450
- Late fees: $237.50

He's been disputing the late fees for 3 months, claiming he never received his statements (we have proof of mailing).

Accounting applied his payment to oldest charges first per policy, which included some late fees. He's now calling saying we "stole his money."

Please contact him and resolve.

---

**Planning Prompts:**

```
This involves accounting policy and a dispute. Help me plan:

1. What's the actual situation (dues vs fees allocation)?
2. What's our policy on payment allocation?
3. Can he legally restrict how his payment is applied?
4. What are his options at this point?
5. What documentation do I need ready before calling?
6. What's my script for explaining payment allocation?
```

## How to Use These Scenarios

1. **Read the ticket carefully** - Identify all issues and emotions
2. **Enter plan mode** - Ask Claude to help you plan (not respond yet)
3. **Build your strategy** - Research, escalation path, response structure
4. **Draft with the plan** - Use your plan to guide the actual response
5. **Review** - Did the plan help you cover everything?
