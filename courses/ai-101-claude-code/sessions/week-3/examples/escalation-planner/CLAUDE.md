# Escalation Planner - Support Plan Mode Practice

## Context

This environment is for practicing **plan mode** with complex support scenarios. Plan mode helps you think through multi-step situations before responding.

## When to Use Plan Mode for Support

Use plan mode when a ticket involves:

- Multiple issues in one request
- Policy exceptions requiring manager input
- Legal or compliance implications
- Angry customers needing de-escalation strategy
- Cross-department coordination

## Planning Framework for Support

Before drafting a response to complex tickets, plan:

1. **Identify all issues** - List every concern the customer raised
2. **Research needed** - What policies/account info do you need?
3. **Decision points** - What can you resolve vs. needs escalation?
4. **Response strategy** - Order of addressing issues, tone approach
5. **Follow-up required** - What happens after sending response?

## Escalation Decision Matrix

| Situation | Action Level | Who Decides |
| --------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Fee waiver under $50 | Tier 1 | Support agent |
| Fee waiver $50-200 | Tier 2 | Team lead |
| Fee waiver over $200 | Tier 3 | Manager |
| Legal threats | Immediate | Manager + Legal |
| Board complaint | Document | Manager |
| Safety concern | Immediate | Emergency protocol |

## Complex Ticket Patterns

**Multi-Issue Tickets:**

- Customer mentions 3+ unrelated problems
- Each may have different resolution paths
- Plan which to address first (usually: safety > billing > general)

**Emotional Escalation:**

- ALL CAPS, multiple exclamation points
- Threats to "call a lawyer" or "go to the news"
- Plan de-escalation before addressing facts

**Policy Edge Cases:**

- Situation doesn't fit standard procedures
- May need exception approval
- Plan research and approval chain

## Practice Tasks

1. Read complex tickets in `complex-tickets.md`
2. Use plan mode to think through each scenario
3. Document your response strategy before drafting
4. Compare your plan to suggested approaches
