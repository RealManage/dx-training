- [ ] Practice the code review workflow
- [ ] Prepare real-world examples
- [ ] Have backup exercises ready

## Instructor Notes

### Key Points to Emphasize

- **Iteration in plan mode** - This is the magic
- **Tactical not strategic** - Just-in-time planning
- **Opus for reviews** - Worth the model switch
- **Systematic execution** - The plan prevents forgotten items

### Common Questions

> **"How long should I stay in plan mode?"**

- 5-10 minutes max for most tasks
- If you're iterating productively, continue
- If you're going in circles, exit and start

> **"Should I plan everything in one session?"**

- No! Plan the next phase only
- Come back to plan mode between phases
- Keep context focused

> **"When is Opus worth it?"**

- Code reviews always
- Security-sensitive code
- Complex architectural decisions
- When you need a second opinion
- Remember: Switch back to Sonnet after!

### Troubleshooting

- If students struggle with plan mode, show the Shift+Tab toggle
- If plans are too long, enforce 5-minute timer
- If they forget `/model opus`, add reminders
- If exercises run long, skip BugHunter

### Assessment

Quick check at end:

1. When should you use plan mode?
2. How do you switch to Opus model?
3. What's the benefit of iterating on plans?
4. Should you plan all phases upfront?
